        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-3">Hi-Collar, East Village</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-[1.05rem]">Tiffany lamps, vintage wood, and bamboo panels— despite deriving its name from the phrase 'high collar,' this hideaway in the East Village is surprisingly low-brow. Inspired by the Japanese Jazz Age— the era that's a personal favorite of mine— Hi-Collar keeps your head moody and dim with its carefully crafted cocktails and pleasant ambiance. While most of our party opted for the yuzu sour— a bubbly mix of shochu, sweet yuzu juice, and soda— I opted for the matcha gin fizz, a surprisingly rich and savory concoction with a squeeze of yuzu to round out its bitters. Hi-Collar boasted a fulsome dinner menu of playful side dishes and satiating platters of Japanese-style sweet spaghetti, rice gratin, and katsu. The star of the show seemed to be, however, the omurice, which I noticed had made its way to the tables of other patrons as well. As always, I used brussel sprouts as the metric by which to gauge the taste of the restaurant: in this case, they were sauteed with half-inch rectangles of king oyster mushroom, balsamic vinegar, honey, and soy sauce, and topped with cashew nuts, parmesan, and parsley. Suffice to say, Hi-Collar has nailed its theme of Cosmopolitan east-meets-west, the zeitgeist at the heart of the jazz age. Other standouts for me at this vibey izakaya included the hayashi omurice, of course, with its light omelette, shiny demi-glace, and fluffy rice. While I may offer little complaint to the tuna tataki, hamburg steak, napolitan spaghetti, and hayashi katsu, they came and went without mention— generally, too saccharine and with little memorability. A favorite, however, was the yakiimo brûlée, torched Japanese sweet potato, which I paired with hojicha ice cream. Unfortunately, after a dinner spread overwhelmingly sweet on the palate, dessert too veered towards saccharine. Regardless, Hi-Collar— with its incredible offering of whiskeys, sake, and shochu, among other creative cocktails— remains a fashionable stop for a night out for some light bites and those with a craving for western-style Japanese fare in an undeniably stylish environment.
